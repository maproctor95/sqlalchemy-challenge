# sqlalchemy-challenge
## Overview of Project

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
* In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. 
    * Precipitation Analysis
    * Station Analysis

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App
* Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
 
### Purpose

I am utilizing SQLAlchemy and Python to analyze data from a database in order to get more detailed information about what the pulled data shows. As well as creating an API for querying. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* During this assignment I was able to complete all the goals and objectives for the assignment. I used what I have learned in the class to trouble shoot the code as I went with Jupyter Notebook and made sure I was fully understanding what each part of my code did through labeling, so when an error popped up I knew how to approach the problem.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* I think the biggest challenge for me was figured out how to do the API creation using FLASK. I hit a lot of errors and road blocks, but breaks and repetition won over and eventually I figured out what I needed to do.
